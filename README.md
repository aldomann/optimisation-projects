# Optimisation Projects

Projects and scripts developed for the Optimisation course given by Lluís Alsedà in the [Master's degree in Modelling for Science and Engineering](http://www.uab.cat/web/estudiar/official-master-s-degrees/general-information/modelling-for-science-and-engineering-1096480962610.html?param1=1307112830469) (2017-2018) of the Autonomous University of Barcelona.

The main topis of the course are:
- Combinatorial Algorithms for graphs (`combinatorial-algorithms`)
- Heuristics and problem representation (`map-routing`)
- Genetic Algorithms (`genetic-algorithms`)
- Simulated Annealing (`simulated-annealing`)
- Ant colony algorithms
- Deterministic optimization
- Machine learning (`neural-networks`)
