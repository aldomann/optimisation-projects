# N Queens Using Genetic Algorithms

This problem consists on placing N queens on a N Ã— N chessboard so that no queen can attack another. In the usual fashion, an attack is defined when two or more queens are in the same row, column, or diagonal, as depicted in the figure below:

The algorithm `n-queens.py` solves the N Queens Problem using a Genetic Algorithm, a metaheuristic inspired by the process of natural selection that belongs to the larger class of evolutionary algorithms.

Moreover, a brute force algorithm is implemented in `brute-queens.py`. Statistical analyses are done using bash and R scripts.
