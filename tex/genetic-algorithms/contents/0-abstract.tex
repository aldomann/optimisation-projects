\begin{abstract}
	Crime Data Analysis is an already established yet flourishing topic in the United States. Despite that, there is no public user-friendly global data hub to visualise crime statistics across the US territory. The goal of this work is to create dynamic time series visualisations of the evolution of crime in different cities of the US. The mission of this work is to develop visualisation tools in order to further ease the access to already open data. Using the R language we gather open databases of different cities and unify the data into a single standard format, leading to straightforward comparative methods. We would like to see whether or not crime statistics change significantly throughout the different regions of the US and if there are clear trends that help us identify geographical differences in the American society. Last but not least, we would like to look for temporal patterns that could be identified with major global or local events.
